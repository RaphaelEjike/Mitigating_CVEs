# Mitigating CVEs
In this lab we will use a real-life scenario of mitigating a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, CVE-2024-21302 is a downgrade vulnerability that resides in the Windows Update installation process. This flaw enables malicious actors to downgrade the Windows operating system to a previous version that may contain vulnerabilities previously patched in newer releases. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could access older, unpatched system flaws and compromise the security of the entire system. Two additional CVEs are related to this downgrade vulnerability: CVE-2024-38202 and CVE-2024-43491. These vulnerabilities are part of a coordinated attack strategy targeting the Windows Update system to degrade the security of Windows environments. To mitigate the risks associated with CVE-2024-21302, Microsoft has provided the KB5042562 update. While this update aims to resolve the downgrade issue, it's essential for organisations to ensure their systems are properly updated and that additional security measures are in place.

# Step-by-Step Guidance for CVE-2024-21302 Mitigation

### Step 1: Identify Vulnerable Systems

Action: Begin by identifying all Windows systems in your organisation, especially those that rely on the Windows Update process for OS upgrades.

- Tool: Use vulnerability management tools like Rapid 7 or Bitsight to scan your network and create an inventory of affected systems.

### Step 2: Apply Patch KB5042562

Action: Immediately apply the KB5042562 update from Microsoft to all Windows devices. This update addresses the CVE-2024-21302 vulnerability.

Process: Ensure the patch is deployed via your central patch management system or use manual updates for critical systems.


### Step 3: Use MITRE ATT&CK to Analyse TTPs

Action: Leverage the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map how the CVE-2024-21302 vulnerability could be used in an attack chain. Focus on the following:

Tactic: Initial Access (using the vulnerability to downgrade systems).

Techniques: Exploitation for privilege escalation or lateral movement.


Benefit: This helps identify how attackers might exploit the flaw and how to better secure your environment against such tactics.


### Step 4: Perform a Risk Assessment

Action: Conduct a risk assessment to determine the likelihood and impact of the vulnerability on your organisation. Consider the following:

- Are vulnerable Windows systems connected to critical business functions?

- How would an attacker gain access to exploit this vulnerability?

- What data or systems are at risk if the attacker is successful?


Outcome: Prioritise remediation efforts based on the risk level.


### Step 5: Monitor and Log Downgrade Activities

Action: Set up monitoring tools to detect any unusual downgrade activities. Use your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to alert administrators to any suspicious attempts to modify the OS version.

- Tool: SIEMs such as Sentinel can be configured to monitor downgrade attempts and trigger alerts.


### Step 6: Review Mitigations and Plan for Future Updates

Action: Stay updated on further patches or mitigations from Microsoft. If the current patch causes instability (e.g., system crashes), monitor for any revisions and plan future updates accordingly.

Monitor: Regularly check Microsoft's Security Update Guide for new patches related to Windows Update vulnerabilities.


### Step 7: Educate and Train Your Teams

Action: Ensure your IT and security teams are aware of the vulnerability and trained to respond quickly to any downgrade-related issues.

Benefit: Awareness and readiness reduce the time attackers have to exploit vulnerabilities in your systems.
